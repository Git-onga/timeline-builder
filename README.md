# 📊 From Dice to Data Science: A Timeline of Statistics and Machine Learning

This project presents an **interactive timeline** that traces the journey of statistics and machine learning — from Renaissance gambling tables to today’s generative AI.  

The timeline highlights **key figures, ideas, and breakthroughs** that transformed probability into statistics, statistics into machine learning, and machine learning into modern **AI systems**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- To **visualize the historical evolution** of statistics and ML.
- To **show connections** between gambling, mathematics, probability, and modern AI.
- To make the history **engaging** through images, multimedia, and storytelling.

## 🏛️ Structure of the Timeline
The timeline is divided into **distinct stages** of development:

1. **🎲 Probability Roots (1500s–1700s)**  
   - Gambling and chance problems.  
   - Cardano, Pascal, Fermat, and Bernoulli.  

2. **📐 Foundations of Statistics (1800s–1930s)**  
   - Galton, Pearson, Fisher, and Kolmogorov formalize statistics.  

3. **🤖 Birth of Machine Learning (1950s–1980s)**  
   - Turing’s question: *Can machines learn?*  
   - Arthur Samuel coins *machine learning*.  
   - Geoffrey Hinton pioneers neural networks.  

4. **🧠 Deep Learning Revolution (2000s–2010s)**  
   - Hinton’s deep belief networks.  
   - **2012 AlexNet breakthrough** — ImageNet competition.  

5. **✨ Generative AI Era (2018–Present)**  
   - From neural nets to transformers.  
   - Modern AI models (ChatGPT, DALL·E, Claude, Gemini, etc.) reshape creativity, work, and society.

## 📌 Features
- **Interactive multimedia timeline** (images, YouTube clips, historical portraits).  
- **Storytelling approach**: Each entry blends academic rigor with human story.  
- **Stage headings**: Highlights turning points in the evolution.

## 🚀 How to Run
Run this website locally:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Fork this repo and place it on your local machine in a folder.
3. Using the command line, CD (change directory) to the folder: cd myTimeline.
4. Use http-server to quickly start up a local server; from your code's folder run npx http-server. You should see a timeline of Whitney Houston's amazing and tragic life.
